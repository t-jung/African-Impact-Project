Sprint Capacity: Estimated 83 story points
 
The goal of this sprint is to create a working back-end using MongoDB and connecting it with the front-end created in sprint1. This includes finishing social media aspects, namely login and registration for individuals, company and partner profile creation, and viewing profiles. We aim to fully implement the user stories related to the login/registration epic, and begin working on stories within the community epic.  Finally, we will begin implementing searching for user profiles and filtered searching (CSCCPROJ-19 & CSCCPROJ-21).
 
Setting up the routing for the front-end and finalizing the design will be completed this sprint (CSCCPROJ-83). This will be handled by Cheryl and Tyler.
 
All remaining user stories in the login/registration epic will be completed. These tasks include completing the setup for the database which include creating profiles based on information passed from the frontend(CSCCPROJ-51, CSCCPROJ-52, CSCCPROJ-53, CSCCPROJ-55, CSCCPROJ-57, CSCCPROJ-58).
Additionally, we plan on setting up the API that will parse the GET requests sent by the user. These requests are mainly viewing other profiles. This includes user stories CSCCPROJ-16, CSCCPROJ-20, CSCCPROJ-47, CSCCPORJ-48, CSCCPROJ-50, CSCCPROJ-56. These user stories will all be handled by Darren, Eugene, Jason, Justin, and Yuanyuan.
 
We will work on user stories CSCCPROJ-19 and CSCCPROJ-21 which involve searching through the database for specific users. This is being split into a front-end and back-end component to handle searching and returning the information to the user. This also includes filtered searching for users based on selected tags. These tasks will be handled by Eugene and Yuanyuan.
 
Finally, user stories in the community epic will be addressed. This includes CSCCPROJ-6, CSCCPROJ-12, CSCCPROJ-93. This involves allowing users to create posts on the website, being able to comment on said posts, and being able to see posts in a feed. This will be handled by Darren.
 
The spikes that we have identified for this sprint include learning Express and MongoDB. This way we have a working server to parse requests from the clients and a database to store user and website data.
