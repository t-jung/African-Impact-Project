Sprint 4 Planning Meeting

Participants: Darren Liu, Cheryl (Pui Lam) Chen, Justin Wang, Tyler (YeonOh) Jung, Eugene Koo, and Yuanyuan Li.

Team Capacity: 56 Story Points, Estimate: 101 Story Points
 
The goal for this sprint is to achieve our minimum viable product. 
This includes: 
- Login/register as user/partner/company
- Messaging system
- Viewing and uploading videos
- Viewing and editing profiles
- Viewing and uploading uploaded assignments from users
- Admin access to admin panel
- Creating and viewing posts
- Viewing calendar and schedule

Of these features, the ones that will be addressed within this sprint are creating recommendations for e-learning content, being able to upload deliverables, and viewing a calendar/schedule.

Furthermore, we had several features that were leftover from sprint 3 that will need to be completed. These included messaging between users, viewing a company profile as an investor and seeing exclusive statistics, and connecting the front-end and back-end (specifically for new features).

Eugene will aim to finish CSCCPROJ-62, which involves creating a functioning messaging system. Furthermore, he will begin working on CSCCPROJ-22, which involves allowing video calls between users.

CSCCPROJ-23 will be completed, which involves allowing investors to access exclusive metrics uploaded by companies to aid in investing. Yuanyuan will handle this task. She will also complete CSCCPROJ-15, which provides recommendations of companies with similar tags.

CSCCPROJ-13 will involve creating a working calendar for users in which they can track tasks, such as deliverable due dates. Jason will handle this task. He will also handle the back-end portion for recommending e-learning content.

Darren will focus on CSCCPROJ-17, which involves creating the back-end for creating deliverables.

Cheryl will be working on CSCCPROJ-119, which allows users to update profile forms to include tags. She will also continue working on both connecting front-end and back-end, leaving comments (front-end), and creating the front-end for uploading and viewing deliverables.

Tyler will be working on the front-end of CSCCPROJ-18, recommending e-learning content. Additionally, he will be working on other front-end tasks such as viewing videos, and creating the viewable calendar for CSCCPROJ-13.

We did not identify any spikes for this sprint.
