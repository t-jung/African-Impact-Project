Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

Participants: This meeting was attended by Darren Liu, Cheryl (Pui Lam) Chen, Justin Wang, Tyler (YeonOh) Jung, Eugene Koo, and Yuanyuan Li.

Unfinished Tasks: Routing front-end together.

Practices that should be continued:
Consistent meeting times
Fast responses between members (excluding pull requests)

Practices that should be implemented: 
Split up work between each team member to more efficiently complete work.
Peer programming for specific tasks.

Harmful practices that should be stopped: 
Focusing all together on a single task. This takes too much time especially given an already short sprint length.
Work more on foundational parts of the application over focusing on the front-end first.

Best/Worst experience during Sprint 1:
There was a lot of planning and administrative stuff to get out of the way, leaving little time in the sprint for coding. Figuring out exactly how our stories should be structured, and how to properly use Jira was a huge time sink after we had to rewrite some stories.
Dealing with the product team and waiting for responses was very annoying and anxiety inducing, especially when responses only came back halfway through the sprint.
Best experience: Having good team bonding and a good team atmosphere.
