The goal of this sprint is to create a front-end for profile creation. This includes login and registration for individuals, along with company and partner profile creation, followed by admin authentication for company and partner profiles. The user stories that we are focusing on in this sprint are CSCCPROJ-5, CSCCPROJ-7, CSCCPROJ-8, CSCCPROJ-30, CSCCPROJ-37 CSCCPROJ-54, and CSCCPROJ-59. These are from the login/registration epic, with CSCCPROJ-7 being part of messaging/communication. Furthermore, aside from database creation (CSCCPROJ-37) all these tasks are related to creating the front-end for profile creation.

For CSCCPROJ-8, this involves creating an interface for users to login and register as individual users on the website. This includes buttons for logging in with external sites like Google. Tyler will be focusing on this user story.

For CSCCPROJ-5, this involves creating a front-end display for viewing the profiles for individuals, companies, and partners. This includes creating a user interface to display information such as user information, buttons for directing messaging, and follow buttons. For companies and partners, this includes company information, company members, and company logistics. This task will be handled by Cheryl and Eugene.

For CSCCPROJ-54 and CSCCPROJ-59, these two tasks function similarly. These will involve creating a user interface for companies and partners to fill with their information when registering, similar to individual profile creation, but it will have more specific fields that need to be filled. These two tasks are being handled by Yuanyuan and Darren respectively.

For CSCCPROJ-30, this involves creating a modified page for admins so that they can view and verify new company and partner profiles, and view tickets for report flags. This will be handled by Justin and Jason.

For CSCCPROJ-7, this involves creating an interface for users to send and receive private messages with each other. Justin will be handling this task.

For CSCCPROJ-37, this task involves setting up a database in order to store user information and e-learning material. This task is being completed by Cheryl.

The spikes of this sprint involve figuring out how to authenticate new users during user registration, creating databases using MongoDB, and creating user interfaces (front-end) with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
