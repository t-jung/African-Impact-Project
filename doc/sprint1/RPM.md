# Release planning Meeting on June 2nd, 2021

## Intro
This meeting was attended by Darren Liu, Cheryl (Pui Lam) Chen, Justin Wang, Tyler (YeonOh) Jung, Eugene Koo, and Yuanyuan Li. It involved the categorization of each user story into epics, prioritizing them, and then writing out a summary of each epic in its relation to Release 1. Everyone has participated through the organization and prioritization of user stories. References to user stories are given based on their JIRA product backlog code. Release 1 for general users will be split into the following 6 epics. These epics are Login/Registration, Messaging and Communication, Community features, E-learning, profile searching, and quality of life.

## Login/Registration
This epic revolves around the ability to create and login to an account which can be viewed, edited, and deleted. Being able to create an individual user profile is the highest priority task, as a majority of the community features rely on users having a profile. This is an extension of two of our user stories (CSCPROJ-5 & CSCPROJ-8). Users will then be able to create company and partner profiles that they can include themselves in. Company profiles will include options for users to upload information about their company so that it is visible to investors (CSCPROJ-20). Company and partner profiles will be verified by the African Impact Challenge team before being enabled(CSCPROJ-30). 

## Messaging and Communication
The initial release of the program will allow for users (individuals, companies, partners) to be able to search for other user profiles. Additionally, users should be able to filter their search results by user tags (CSCPROJ-7). 

## Community
This epic involves features about how the target user (individual, companies, partners) are interacting with the community. The ability to view company details (pitch decks, financials, etc.) for investing purposes is ranked in the high level priority (CSCPROJ-23). Users will also be able to create, comment, and upvote forum posts around various topics and sub-topics in order to generate discussion and ask questions (CSCPROJ-6 & CSCPROJ-12). 

## E-Learning
For release 1, the product should enable users to view pre-recorded content created by the African Impact Challenge group (CSCPROJ-4 & CSCPROJ-10). They will also be able to provide deliverables for e-learning workshops and tutorials (CSCPROJ-17). Finally, users should be recommended initial e-learning content which will help users get accustomed to the product (CSCPROJ-18). 

## Profile Searching
This epic relates to the ability for users to search for other users. Users should be able to search for users, companies, and partners. Additionally, users should be able to filter their searches by specific tags, such as skills (CSCPROJ-19 & CSCPROJ-21).

## Quality of Life
The features under this epic are related to improving user experience and reducing user effort. Users will be given travel guidance on how to use the app and recommended action based on their registration information (CSCPROJ-15). Also, users should be able to see similar companies based on their browsing history (CSCPROJ-9). All the features under this epic are currently ranked in the low level.
