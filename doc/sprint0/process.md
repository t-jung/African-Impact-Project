## Organization

One person is the task delegator (Justin), and tasks are delegated to group members afterwards. If certain group members want certain tasks, they can communicate with the task delegator to gain priority. Any disagreements during task delegation will be resolved democratically. Darren is in charge of taking Minutes.

Our team was initially formed through mutual connections within the class community. We will use the following tools:

- We decided on using JIRAs for storing user stories and our product backlog.
- We will be using GitHub for version control (amongst the team) for this project.
- Planning Poker will be used for deciding points of user stories.
- Discord was decided to be used for team meetings (both voice and text.

## Decisions

We thoroughly discuss multiple decisions as a group, and make decisions democratically by voting. With seven people, we will never have a tie. Voting is done anonymously so votes wonâ€™t be swayed by others. 

## Priority & Points

**Priority:** Decided by the product owner and the main information provided in the African Impact Challenge Document.

**Points:** Discussed the approach of completing the tasks, and then used planning poker to vote on tasks. Multiple rounds of voting may be used; alternatively tasks can be broken into subtasks.
We defined a point to be an hour of uninterrupted work.

- Points can be of the following denominations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

## Frequency of Meetings

We schedule our meetings on Monday and Thursday from 9PM-11PM EST. Extra meetings are scheduled on other days at the discretion of the group, and whether more time needs to be allotted for finishing tasks. The dates for these meetings are usually determined during the end of a meeting.

## Lessons for Next Phase

We should familiarize ourselves with what tasks need to be done early on into the sprint, and better space out our meetings. We should have a system for delegating tasks, as in this sprint, we did everything collectively on one document, with each member doing tasks as they saw fit.
