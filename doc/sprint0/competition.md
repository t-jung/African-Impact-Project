Competition: LinkedIn [https://ca.linkedin.com/], Coursera [https://www.coursera.org/]

LinkedIn:

- Similarity: Provides individual and company profile creation, some degree of networking and communicating platform by allowing posts/blogs and messaging system

- Compared to our product: While including individual and company profile creation, we also provide partner profile creation. Our platform will also allow all users to be more included in the community by providing a platform that allows more interactive interactions between users.

- Linkedin is catered for companies and users only as it is intended as an employment and networking platform. It is not focused on helping entrepreneurs finding investors, unlike our product. Secondly, due to the intended use of Linkedin, it does not focus on creating a community among its users, focusing instead on one-to-one communication. This makes sense for individuals who are focused on job searching.

Coursera:

- Similarity: Provides offline virtual pre-recorded content that allows users to consume in a self-paced manner, it also has features for allowing users to upload submissions and completions. It also has a discussion board within each workshop that allows students to interact with each other in the form of blogs.

- Compared to our product: We provide offline virtual pre-recorded content that allows users to consume in a self-paced manner while also providing live workshops/sessions to give better user experiences in terms of networking and interactions, aiming for a more interactive learning experience. We would also have embedded calendar and scheduling features for the users.
