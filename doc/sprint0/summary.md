# Summary

**Objective:** Create a community platform for the African Impact Challenge which allows individuals, companies and partners (i.e. investors, service providers and corporations) to have organic interaction. For aspiring entrepreneurs, this platform will also have an E-Learning component which will contain pre-recorded content, assignment submissions, scheduling functionality and video conferencing.

**Key Users:** Our key users are:

- Aspiring entrepreneurs who are eager to learn on how to bring their solutions to life.

- Companies looking to sign up for a platform to communicate with possible partners or looking to recruit individuals.

- Partners (investor, service providers, corporations) who are looking to invest or partner with companies on the platform.

**Key Usage Scenarios:**

- Individuals who want an opportunity to learn more about how to bring their solution to life (business setup training) through virtual pre-recorded content, testing, and workshops. Also, individuals wanting to find business partners or apply for jobs.

- Provide opportunities for aspiring entrepreneurs who have registered on the platform to participate in workshops (pre-recorded content or live), where they can complete and submit deliverables, schedule and book meetings (such as mentorship) on a calendar.

- Partners / Companies wanting to connect with or invest in other Companies / Partners.

- Startup companies that are looking to scout individuals and/or investment.

**Key Principle:** We want to focus on usability over all else to reduce the initial hurdle of joining the platform. The design should adhere to Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design and Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design.
