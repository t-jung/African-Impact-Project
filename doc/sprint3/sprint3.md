The goal of this sprint is to complete the core features of e-learning content as documented in the product backlog, such as watching and uploading videos. Furthermore, we aim to complete leftover tasks from sprint 2, including commenting/upvoting posts, viewing user post feeds, and connecting the front-end and back-end.

For commenting/upvoting posts (CSCCPROJ-6), Darren and Tyler will continue working on creating a front-end display for leaving comments on user posts. Additionally, Darren will implement the liking system for posts (back-end) and being able to view them as well (CSCCPROJ-93). 

Tyler and Cheryl will continue to finalize the front-end, an ever-evolving process as the design of the front-end grows with the implementation of e-learning content. (CSCCPROJ-83).

Eugene and Yuanyuan will also continue working on the community aspect of the application, where direct messaging between users (CSCC01PROJ-62) will be worked on by Eugene, and viewing the company profile as a partner (CSCC01PROJ-23) will be completed by Yuanyuan.

Jason will begin working on the back-end of storing e-learning content. This involves both uploading and getting e-learning content (CSCCPROJ-10).

Justin will continue working on administrator abilities, this time working on allowing administrators to modify e-learning content, and uploading new content (CSCCPROJ-4).

Cheryl, along with the other team members, will continue to work on connecting the front-end and back-end so that the app works properly. This includes leftover connecting from the previous sprint, and connecting that will be required for e-learning content (CSCCPROJ-102).

We did not identify any spikes for this sprint.
